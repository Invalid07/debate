This project is an AI debate system using  LangGraph. It sets up two AI "players" (using llm models) to debate a user-provided topic and a third AI "judge" to evaluate their arguments and determine a winner. The system uses a state graph to manage the flow of the debate, allowing for parallel argument generation by the two players before the judge makes a final decision.
